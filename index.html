		<h2>PRATEEK PURANIK</h2>
		<p>I looking for challenging problems to solve. My background is in  software development, however, I have an insatiable curiosity for Web-Development and AI – particularly deep learning – applications and their potential to change the technology landscape.<br><br>

I’m making this portfolio in the hope to provide some insight into the world of an ever learning and evolving developer.<br><br>
As much as I love sitting at my computer and solving problems, I need regular breaks to maintain my focus. After two hours staring at a screen, I need to take a short walk to clear my head and get my body active.<br><br>

I like to eat junk food and long walks on the beach. Very long walks. Lots of people say they like long walks on the beach, but then they get out on the beach and after just an hour or two, they say they’re getting tired.</p>
